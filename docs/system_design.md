## Intention behind the Change
The intention behind this change is to temporarily replace the existing Snake game implementation with a simple 'hello world' program. This is done to demonstrate the ability to modify the codebase and showcase the process of making changes. The Snake game functionality will be restored in subsequent updates. Please note that this change is not intended to permanently remove the Snake game logic.
