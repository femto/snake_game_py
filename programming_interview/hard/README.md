# Hard Challenge: Snake Path Finder

## Introduction
In the classic snake game, finding the optimal path to the food without colliding with the boundaries or itself is a challenging task. Your task is to write a function that finds the shortest path for the snake to reach the food without colliding.

## Problem Statement
Write a function `find_path` that takes in three arguments:

1. A list of tuples representing the current segments of the snake, where each tuple is `(x, y)`.
2. A tuple representing the current position of the food as `(food_x, food_y)`.
3. An integer `grid_size` representing the size of the grid (e.g., `grid_size = 10` for a 10x10 grid).

The function should return a list of strings representing the shortest path to the food, where each string can be one of the following: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT". If no path is found, return an empty list.

## Input-Output Specifications
- Input:
  - A list of tuples `segments` where each tuple is `(x, y)` representing the snake's segments.
  - A tuple `(food_x, food_y)` representing the food's position.
  - An integer `grid_size` where `1 <= grid_size <= 100`.
- Output:
  - A list of strings representing the path to the food or an empty list if no path is found.

## Example Cases
1. Input: `segments = [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)], food = (5, 4), grid_size = 10`
   Output: `["UP"]`
   
2. Input: `segments = [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)], food = (0, 0), grid_size = 10`
   Output: `[]`
